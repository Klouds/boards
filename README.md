#SoC Platforms and their Mainlininess / Support in Linux OSS ecosystem

Platform | Good | Bad | Prices Start At
--- | --- | --- | ---
**Allwinner A20** | nearly 100% mainlined, graphics are the holdout, but LIAM driver is available | It's older and slower than h3 | $27
**Allwinner H3**  | Very fast!  Very Cheap! | no network, but can use USB dongle for network.  Can run hot.  | $10 - 512mb $15 1GB
**Allwinner A64** | 64 bit, cheap | Not terribly fast, just quick.  | $15 - 1gb $30 - 2gb
**Rockchip rk3128** | Mainlined | I don't know the disadvantages yet. | $20
**Rockchip rk3188** | Mainlined.  Fast.  Cheap.  2gb editions. |  It's older, but in this case I don't see how that matters. | $20
Rockchip rk3368 | Fast? | It is so badly supported I have to put a question mark after the word fast. | $50
Rockchip rk3288 | Fast.  Mainlined.  | Expensive compared to 3188, 3128 | $60
Intel Atom | x86, open source graphics drivers | Expensive, questionable speed benefit | $35 (for tv boxes, few dev platforms are avialable)
Marvell 805 | fast, newish, moves towards mainlining | not mainlined, not much to distinguish it | $40
Marvell 905 | fast and newer, some mainlined code | not fully mainlined | $60
